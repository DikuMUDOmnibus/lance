0 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'imm') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, is simply to make the game fun and enjoyable, No 
they are not always very nice sweet people they do work hard to build a 
mud that players can try and find a escape from real life. The very idea 
of immortals is a topic of heavy and heated debates, and are fraught with 
misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

0 Tanis~
Tanthalas "Tanis" Half-Elven
 
This is me! I was born in 258A.C. I am the son of Elansa Kanan, who was sister to the Speaker of the Sun, Solostaran. It has never been easy for me to admit this but she was raped by a human during a raid. I met him once in a village called Ankatavaka, 
but thats another story... listen to me, I sound like Tasslehoff, ALWAYS rattling off at the mouth.
 
Solostarian raised me as his own, but everyone knew that I was different. While I was growing up I met Flint Fireforge, and I decided that it was time to carve my own path though life. 
I had no idea that I would be caught up in a war, much less the War of the Lance.
 
My efforts in the War earned me an Honorary title in the Knights of Solamnia, and shortly after the War, Laurana and I were married.
 
I was slain defending the High Clerist Tower from the Knights of Takhisis in 383A.C.

Flint Fireforge
 
 Flint was one of my closest friends. He and I have had a lot of good memories. He was born in Hillhome, in 212A.C. I met him in Qualinesti, his magnificent wood carvings had earned him the honor of being allowed to stay inside the city. 

When we left Qualinesti, he went to Solace and met the Majere Twins. His time there was spent looking after the two as a father figure.

Flint died on the way to Neraka, during the War of the Lance. He now sits under a tree waiting for his "little buddy".

The Knights of Takhisis is a clan born out of the ruin of the Dragonarmies. Avoiding the pitfalls that plagued the Dragonarmies and brought about their own self-destruction,
the Knights of Takhisis were formed to be the elite fighting force to further the cause of the Dark Queen Takhisis herself. 
Through careful study of the enemy forces of the Solamnic Knights, it was found that they in fact posses some admiral though the Solamnic Knights are overall flawed. The Knights of Takhisis adopted some of these principles and improved where things
were lacking. qualities,
Thus was born a group worthy of serving Takhisis. Its members are devoutly loyal to her and each other. In fact, their very lives are expendable for the good of the clan. Those who fail to live up to this devotion faces but one thing: death. 

The Knights of Takhisis are a prime example of pride and honor, much more than the arrogant Solamnic Knights. New members of the Knights of Takhisis are usually those who have been trained to serve since childhood,
though many of the older members are remnants of the fallen Dragonarmies who have accepted the weakness of the former methods of serving Takhisis.
 
 
The Knights of Takhisis are made up of three orders of knights, each focusing on their own goals but coming together to compliment one another.

their choice of profession.  Each member gives a part of their spoils to the
group as a whole, to help the less fortunate members of the group as a
whole.  Any race is allowed, except for warriors, and race/deity matters
not, only skills.  If you are not of thief class, you MUST Rp as a thief, if

maintain several avatars at one time, and Astinus may be one of them.  In
whatever form, Zivilyn wields a simple wooden cane that obey s any command
it is given.  Zivilyn, god of all wisdom, is the celestial Tree of Life. 
His branches and roots extend into all times and places.  Much as Gilean
holds the knowledge of the universe, Zivilyn holds its wisdom.  He acts not
according to the dictates of his mind, but according to those of his heart. 
Because wisdom is incomplete without knowledge and knowledge is incomplete
without wisdom, Zivilyn and Gilean work closely together.  Zivilyn is the
companion of Chislev; most mortals view this relationship as a perfect
marriage.

0 Builder~
Builders are a crazy lot, they take pride in there work and have no problems talking about the area for long hours.
To begin a Builder for this mud you have twice options you can try and use.
the First being a Mortal Builder, all Mortals wishing to build should send a E-Maill to Takhisis at: Takhisis_legends_lance@dragonlance.zzn.com   She will need to have information such as where have you built before.
how often you can build, how much can you build, how good you are with time tables.
so that she can proccess this quickly please use subject: Mortal Builder Legends :so that she can be sure to read it.
 
The last option is to become a Immortal, hmm just ask a Immortal how to do that.
~

102 JOBS~
This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

Builders:(102-103)
You main job as a builder is to come up with Ideas for new areas and to 
let the Headbuilders know, they will take the idea to a imp for approvel. You
May run Quests with the help of Higher up Immortals, Just don't expect to 
be allowed to go crazy with your quests.

Questers:(104-105)
Questers have two main roles: Building and  quest running. You can draft 
Builders to help you run a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have
huge rewards -- the main point should be to have fun. Questers have no  
business trying to enforce rules -- the most you should do to a player is
NOCHANNEL or similar light punishment.

Gods:(106-108)
Gods can run quests just like Questers, and it's nice to do reimbursements 
too. However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can 
enforce (but not create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, 
as well as deny, purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these 
commands!)  Gods are expected to help make the mud run more smoothly, 
power trips are strictly verbotten.

Not fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.

0 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all clan members 
(including loners), provided the victim is is within 8 levels of the
character and is also in a clan.  This will flag you as a "killer" or
"thief", allowing any character to attack, and also provoking action
from the city guard.

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of ROM **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.
